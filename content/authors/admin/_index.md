Welcome! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Jesse Chan](https://jlchan.github.io/) in the Department of Computational Applied Mathematics & Operations Research at Rice University. My research interests include mathematical physics and numerical methods for PDEs, and I'm currently working on entropy stable reduced order modeling of nonlinear conservation laws using discontinuous Galerkin methods.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Math and Statistics with Highest Distinction from [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). My undergraduate research, guided by Prof. [Pedro Sáenz](https://www.pml.unc.edu/about-me) and Prof. [Rodolfo Rosales](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=228), focused on hydrodynamics spin lattices (HSLs).
