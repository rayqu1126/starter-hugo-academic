Welcome! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. [Jesse Chan](https://jlchan.github.io/), in the Department of Computational Applied Mathematics & Operations Research at Rice University. My research interests include mathematical physics and numerical methods for PDEs, and I'm currently working on entropy stable reduced order modeling (ES-ROM) of nonlinear conservation laws using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.

Outside of Rice, I'll spend 2024 summer in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group (T-5), Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), applying model order reduction to uncertain quantification (UQ) problems in stochastic PDE systems.

I received my Bachelor of Science in both Mathematics and Statistics with Highest Distinction from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My undergraduate research, under the mentorship of Prof. [Pedro Sáenz](https://www.pml.unc.edu/about-me) and with assistance from Prof. [Rodolfo Rosales](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=228), was on active spinwaves in hydrodynamics spin lattices (HSLs).
